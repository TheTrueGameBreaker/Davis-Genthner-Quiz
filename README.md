# Davis-Genthner-Quiz

I made this for a class project

The code cotains a short 16 question quiz game. If you get to the final question and awswer before the timer runs out the game will not save your highscore. Just wait for the timer to hit 0 and then answer, it will still work.

I also could not get the score to add properly so as of right now it just tracks your progress.

I aslo missed three days of class because I had to take my GF to the ER and could not attend to I had to learn all of this on my own and may have done a poor job.
